        <p>Jeon Jung-kook (born September 1, 1997), known mononymously as Jungkook, 
        is a South Korean singer. He is a member and vocalist of the South Korean boy band BTS.
        Jungkook has performed three solo songs as part of BTS' discography—"Begin" in 2016, "Euphoria" in 
        2018, and "My Time" in 2020—all of which charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He also 
        recorded the soundtrack song "Stay Alive" for the BTS-based webtoon 7Fates: Chakho. In 2022, 
        he featured on American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth's single "Left and Right", which peaked at 
        number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he became the first South Korean artist to 
        release an official song for the FIFA World Cup soundtrack with "Dreamers", which he subsequently 
        performed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony. In 2023, Jungkook released his debut solo 
        single "Seven" featuring Latto, which simultaneously debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 
        100, the Global 200, and the Global Excl. US charts, making him the first Korean solo artist to 
        do so. It also became the fastest song in Spotify history to surpass 100 million streams on the 
        platform.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungkook">For More</a></p>
